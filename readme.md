# Transients

Transients allows you to easily capture, share and track sounds with listeners across the world. 

When a sound is recorded, it is automatically uplodaed to a server with your location, as well as an optional description. 

Listerners are able to hear your sounds, called "transients", when they get physically close to where the sound was recorded.

This repo holds general information about transients, including technical notes, spec sheets, data schemas, brainstorming sessions, designs, and other ideas.
